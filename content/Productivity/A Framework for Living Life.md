My framework for going about life. 

# Overview
A common answer when people respond to the question **“What is the purpose of life?”** is **“to be happy.”** But can't we be happy while being stagnant in life? Why is a life of working better than a life spending every waking hour playing video games or rotting in bed? What gives us reason to push forward? This framework was the outcome of experiencing this conflicting view firsthand.

After parsing through multiple sources regarding purpose and productivity, I settled on a framework for thinking about life through a pyramid composed of 4 levels.

# Purpose
At the most fundamental level, it's necessary to figure out what you wish to get out life. Without a driving force, I believe it's inevitable that there'll be times in which feelings of doubt and meaninglessness for what you're working towards will sprout.

To derive a purpose, begin to look within yourself. While you may admire others and the lives they live, it's your inner voice which you have to pay attention to and form a connection with. To hear your inner voice, we need to reduce external stimulation that's caused us to externalize our attention.
