My framework for going about life. 

# Overview
A common answer when people respond to the question **“What is the purpose of life?”** is **“to be happy.”** But can't we be happy while being stagnant in life? Why is a life of working better than a life spending every waking hour playing video games or rotting in bed? What gives us reason to push forward? This framework was the outcome of experiencing this conflicting view firsthand.
