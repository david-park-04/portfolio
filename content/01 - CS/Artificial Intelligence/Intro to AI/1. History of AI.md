# What is AI?
Broadly construed, artificial intelligence is the field of creating machines or systems that mimic human intelligence. What exactly this involves, however, is less well defined due to the complexity of understanding intelligence. Hence, AI can be described using a task-oriented approach, involving various abilities.

# Overview of the Field
Given that AI is the field of creating machines or systems that mimic human intelligence, it involves different subfields.

Machine learning is a subset of AI, involving machines learning from data. Deep learning is then a subset of machine learning, involving machine learning with neural networks.

Classical/symbolic AI is an alternative approach to AI from machine learning, where we explicitly tell machines what to do.

# Basic History
- ~400 BC: Idea of AI
- 1950: Turing Test - Can an AI pass as human?
- Summer of 1956: Working to encapsulate and define intelligence for a machine (still ongoing!)

# Terminology
- Strong AI: Human-level intelligence of an AI
- Weak (or Narrow) AI: AI that's less intelligent than strong AI
- Superintelligence: AI that far exceeds human intelligence
