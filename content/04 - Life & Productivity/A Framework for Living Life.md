A framework for going about life. 

# Overview
A common answer when people respond to the question **“What is the purpose of life?”** is **“to be happy.”** But isn't it possible to feel happy even while being stagnant? Why is a life of hard work then seen as more meaningful than one spent indulging in comfort and escapism? What drives us to push forward at all? This framework emerged from grappling with this tension firsthand.

Learning from multiple sources regarding productivity and purpose, I settled on a framework for thinking about life through a pyramid composed of 4 levels, with an understanding of lower levels helping support those above it.

# Purpose
*What do you want out of life?*

At the most fundamental level, it's necessary to determine what you want out of life. Without figuring out your driving force, it's inevitable that there'll be times in which feelings of doubt for what you're working towards will sprout.

To derive this purpose, a greater sense of clarity has to be gained through reducing attention towards easy dopamine sources. Attention given to these sources cause it to become increasingly difficult to maintain vision of and alignment with what we really value. Distancing yourself from these time-sinks will undoubtably be difficult, with intense feelings of boredom urging you to give in to temptations, but know that this is just your brain complaining to you in its sneaky little way. It'll attempt to bargain with you on what you already planned to be a done deal in hopes of gaining an inch of ground. When these feelings arise, stand true to what you said you would accomplish, as it's only then it becomes possible to start diminishing the whiny acts of the brain. The decisions you make in these moments should never, ever be taken lightly. They're what separate you from the path you wish to go and the path to feelings of regret and lack of fulfillment. Believe in the accumulation of your actions.

# Values
*Who do you want to become?*

Once an idea of what you wish to get out of life is determined, a more tangible vision of who you wish to become can be formulated. Ask yourself the following:
- What do I want to become good at or knowledgeable of?
- What hobbies do I wish to pick up?
- What type of characteristics do I hope to have?

With a mental picture of the ideal version of your future self, let this version of you stand as an intermediary between your impulses and your actions. Let it monitor your decisions from here on forth, while you work to embody your future self under its guidance.

# Systems
*Methods to keep in check.*

Beyond reasons for why, it's important to recognize the pitfalls in how.

## Cutting Distractions
**Dopamine**
- Dopamine heavy activities increase the price you have to pay to experience joy.
- You need to work to satisfy biological drives (agency, identity, community, etc.), but having easy sources of dopamine strip away this necessary work done by the brain.

**Discipline**
- While you don't have to always grit your teeth and do everything 100%, you do have to keep the ball rolling and continuously take steps towards where you want to go.
- Don't be so caught up in one day that you lose sight of your whole life.
- Retain full consciousness of your actions.

**Consistency**
- Understand that you don't exist beyond today, you only live for this current moment in time.
- Inherit the life of the person who lived the day before you and serve the life of the person ahead of you.

## Emotion Regulation
**Motivation**
- Separate how your feelings and thoughts from your actions.
- Question what about yourself, your identity, is so unwilling to do something.

**Happiness**
- $Happiness = \frac{Haves}{Wants}$
- Decrease what you want vs. increasing what you have by practicing gratitude.
- Extend the period of contentment for the things you obtain, increasing the window of reflection.

**Loneliness/Boredom**
- Create emotionally salient/charged experiences that build your relationship with yourself. Find something challenging or new.
- Create things - either some small project or contributing towards something.
- Look to hobbies (reading, exercising, sports, cooking, etc.).

**Stress**
- Your reaction to feelings of stress is a choice. Let these feelings be dealt with through decisive action.

# Execution
*Plan for achievement.*

Simple steps to adopt for making progress.
- Time management - failing to plan is planning to fail
	- Keep track of events through a calendar
- Routine - things to not compromise on 
- Journalling - be conscious of changes from day to day
- Meditate - train your ability to be present
