## Discrete Random Variables  
A discrete random variable is a variable that can take on a finite number of values realized by the outcomes from the sample space of a random phenomenon.

Alternatively, there are also [[5. Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions]].

**Properties of Discrete Random Variables**  
- Expected value
	- $\mu_x = \sum_xxP(x)$ 
- Variance
	- $\sigma_x^2 = \sum_x(x-\mu_x)^2P(x)$ 
	
### Probability Distributions
**Probability Distribution Function**  
A probability distribution function represent the probability that a random variable $X$ will take on a value.  
- $P(x) = P(X = x)$

**Cumulative Probability Distribution**  
A cumulative probability distribution represents the probability that a random variable $X$ will not exceed a value $x_0$.
- $F(x_0) = P(X \leq x_0)$ 

**Binomial Distribution**  
In the case we have the binomial setting -- several trials, consistency of probabilities, and independence -- we have the binomial distribution. 

If we have the binomial distribution, we have a count $X$ with mean and standard deviation:
- Mean
	- $\mu_x = nP$
- Variance 
	- $\sigma_x = \sqrt{nP(1-P)}$

## Jointly Distributed Discrete Random Variables
Given a pair of discrete random variables, we can consider their outcomes jointly. 

**Properties**
- Independence
	- $P(x,y) = P(x)P(y)$
- Conditional mean
	- $\mu_{Y|X} = \sum_y{(y|x)P(y|x)}$
- Conditional variance
- Covariance 
	- $Cov(x,y) = \sum_{x}\sum_{y}{(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)P(x,y)}$
- Correlation 
	- $\rho = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}}$

### Probability Distributions
**Joint Probability Distribution**  
The probability of two discrete random variables taking on specific values.
- $P(x,y) = P(X = x \cap Y = y)$

**Marginal Probability Distribution**
- $P(x) = \sum_{y}{P(x,y)}$

**Conditional Probability Distribution**  
The probability of a variable given the fixed value for another.
- $P(y | x) = \frac{P(y \cap x)}{P(x)}$
