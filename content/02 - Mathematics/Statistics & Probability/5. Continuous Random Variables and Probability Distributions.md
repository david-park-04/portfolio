## Continuous Random Variables
Unlike discrete random variables, continuous random variables can take on any value within an interval. 

### Probability Distributions
**Uniform Distributions**  
For a uniform distribution, all intervals of the same length are equally probable to contain a value.

Given this distribution, we can easily find the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function to determine the probabilities for values to fall within intervals.

**Normal Distribution**  
A normal distribution is characterized by properties such as a symmetric, bell-shaped curve centered on the mean and the total area under the curve summing to 1.

From a normal distribution, we have a good descriptor of real data and can perform various statistical inference procedures.
