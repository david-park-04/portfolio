## Measures of Center
**Mean**
- Population mean: $\mu = (1/N) \sum{x_i}$ 
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = (1/n) \sum{x_i}$

**Median**
- Midpoint of the distribution.
- $(n+1)/2$

The median is considered a more **resistant** measure of center than the mean.
## Measures of Spread
- Range: The difference between the largest and smallest value in a data set.
- Pth percentile: The value such that P% of the data set is at or below the value.
- Quartiles: Splits the data set into quarters.
	- IQR: The difference between the third and first quartiles. 

The IQR is considered a more **resistant** measure of spread than the range.

- Variance
	- Population variance: $\sigma^2 = (1/N) \sum{(x_i - \mu)^2}$ 
	- Sample variance: $s^2 = (1/n+1) \sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$
- Standard deviation
	- Population standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{(1/N) \sum{(x_i - \mu)^2}}$ 
	- Sample standard deviation: $s = \sqrt{(1/n+1) \sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$ 

**Linear Transformation**
- A linear transformation changes a variable $x$ to $x_{new}$ according to the following equation:
	- $x_{new} = a + bx$

**Standardizing**
- Standardizing can be done to put variables on the same scale, allowing us to gain perspective on how a variable compares to others.
