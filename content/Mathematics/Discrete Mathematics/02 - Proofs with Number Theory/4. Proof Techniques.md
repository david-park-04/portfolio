A proof is a valid argument for the truth of a mathematical statement. There are numerous techniques that can be utilized to establish arguments for truth. 

# Direct Proof
The direct proof strategy is used to prove an implication. The template for writing direct proofs is as follows:
1) Introduce variables
2) Make assumptions
3) Explain assumptions and what they mean, "unrolling" definitions
4) Apply algebra, logic, reasoning to reach a conclusion
5) "Reroll" definitions upon reaching the conclusion
6) Conclude the proof
