**Defining Even and Odd**
An integer $n$ is even if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$. An integer $n$ is odd if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k+1$. 

**Closure Properties** 
When performing operations between integers, any operations involving addition, subtraction, or multiplication result in an integer output.
