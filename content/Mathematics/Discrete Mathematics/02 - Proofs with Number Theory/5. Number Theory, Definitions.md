**Defining Even and Odd**
An integer $n$ is even if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$. An integer $n$ is odd if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k+1$. 

**Closure Properties** 
When performing operations between integers, any operations involving addition, subtraction, or multiplication result in an integer output. 

**Divisibility**
For integers $a$ and $b$, we say that $a$ divides $b$ if there exists some integer k such that $b = a \cdot k$. The notation for $a$ dividing $b$ is $a \mid b$.

**Modular Arithmetic**
For integers $a,b,m$ with $m > 0$, $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ if $m \mid (a - b)$. The notation for $a$ congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ is $a \equiv b$ (mod $m$).
