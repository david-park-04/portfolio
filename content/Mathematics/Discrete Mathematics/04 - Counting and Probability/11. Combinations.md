A combination for a set of distinct object is an unordered arrangement of those objects.

Given that it is an unordered arrangement, the number of combinations can be found by extending what we learned for permutations. 

The number of k-combinations can be found through: 

${}_{n}C_k = \frac{{}_{n}P_{k}}{k!}$

Symmetry

${}_{n}C_{k} = {}_{n}C_{n-k}$ 

Pascal's Rule

${}_{n}C_{k} = {}_{n-1}C_{k-1} + {}_{n-1}C_{k}$
