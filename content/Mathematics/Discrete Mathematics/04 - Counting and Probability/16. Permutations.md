A permutation for a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of those objects.

The total number of permutations can then be found for all sequences and restricted sequences by utilizing factorials and the product rule:

- Permutations
	$n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)...3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!$

- k-Permutations (Restricted sequences), where we restrict the number of steps to $k$
	${}_{n}P_{k} = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ 

# Preventing Over-Counting
When calculating the number of permutations, it's necessary to be cautious to consider the possibility of duplicates. To account for duplicates, we can divide the number of permutations by the factorials of duplicate objects.

For example, the total number of anagrams for Mississippi would be
	$\frac{11!}{4! \cdot 4! \cdot 2!}$

# Complement Counting
When finding the number of permutations for some event, it might be easier to consider the cases where the event does not occur.

**Complement Rule**: If the set you are counting is $A$, and it belongs to some universe $U$, then:
	$|A| = |U| - |A^U|$
