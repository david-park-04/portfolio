A permutation for a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of those objects.

The total number of permutations can then be found for all sequences and restricted sequences by utilizing factorials and the product rule:

- Permutations
	$n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)...3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!$

- k-Permutations (Restricted sequences)
	${}_{n}P_{k} = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ 

# Preventing Over-Counting
When calculating the number of permutations, it's necessary to be cautious to consider the possibility of duplicates. To account for duplicates, we can divide the number of permutations by
