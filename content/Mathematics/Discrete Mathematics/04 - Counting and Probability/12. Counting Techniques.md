# Pigeonhole Principle
If $n+1$ objects are placed into $n$ boxes, then some box has to have $> 1$ object.

# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
The inclusion-exclusion principle is allows us to account for overcounting from unions.

Inclusion-Exclusion (2 sets): 

$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

Inclusion-Exclusion (3 sets):

$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$

- The inclusion-exclusion principle for 3 sets can be generalized further to $n$ sets

# Stars and Bars
Stars and bars is a technique that accounts for overcounting when it can't be accounted for by simply dividing. This means that the stars and bars technique is necessary when there exists cases which aren't overcounted. 

It allows us to count the number of ways to group $n$ indistinguishable objects into $k$ distinguishable buckets:

${}_{n+k-1}C_{k-1}$

# Binomial Theorem
For any $x,y$ and any integer $n \geq 0$:

$(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {}_{n}C_{k} \cdot x^{n-k} \cdot y^k$
