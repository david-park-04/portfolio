# Overview
In a simple graph, a walk is a sequence of vertices $v_1,...,v_k$ such that $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$, i.e. there exists an edge for each pair of vertices in the sequence. The length of a walk is the number of edges connecting these vertices. 

A path is a stricter definition of a walk, where we have a sequence of vertices $(v_i, v_{i+1})$, but there are no repeat vertices.
	- When evaluating connectedness, a connected graph is one in which there exists a path between all pairs of vertices. If this is not the case, we have a disconnected graph which may have connected components.

A closed walk is another stricter definition of a walk, in which there the starting and ending vertex must be the same. 

A cycle can then be thought of as a sort of combination of both a path and closed walk, having no repeat vertices and the same starting and ending vertex.
