A graph $G = (V,E)$ is a pair of sets, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges holding pairs of vertices $(v_i, v_j)$. The order of the pairs, ordered or unordered, are determined by the category of graph.

# Overview
There are two general categories of graphs: directed and undirected graphs. As intuition suggests, directed graphs have edges with direction while undirected graphs have edges without.

A common type of graph that's discussed is simple graphs. For simple graphs, they are denoted by the characteristics that they are undirected, have no self-loops, have no weights, and have no parallel edges.

For a given edge $e$ with two vertices $v_i, v_j$, we say that the vertices connected by the edge are neighbors and the edge is incident to both vertices.

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to the given vertex.
