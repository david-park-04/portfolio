Many statements in mathematics can't be expressed simply through propositional logic. With propositional logic lacking expressiveness, predicate logic tackles this by adding the notion of variables and quantifiers. 

Predicate logic can be thought of as composed of three fundamental parts:
1) Sets
2) Predicates
3) Quantifiers

# Overview
A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. We write $x \in A$ to denote an element $x$ in the set $A$. 

A predicate is a statement containing variables that evaluates to true or false depending on the value of the variable. The possible values for the variables is defined through the domain.

A quantifier makes a predicate true or false. There exists two standard quantifiers: existential and universal.

For quantifiers, pay attention to:
- Implications under quantifiers
- Negation for quantifiers
- Nested quantifiers
