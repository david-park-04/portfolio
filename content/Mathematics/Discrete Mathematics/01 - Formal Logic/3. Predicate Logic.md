Many statements in mathematics can't be expressed simply through propositional logic. With propositional logic lacking expressiveness, predicate logic tackles this by adding the notion of variables and quantifiers. 

Predicate logic can be thought of as composed of three fundamental parts:
1) Sets
2) Predicates
3) Quantifiers
