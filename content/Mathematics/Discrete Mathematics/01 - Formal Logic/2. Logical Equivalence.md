For two propositions to be considered the same, they must be logically equivalent. We denote logical equivalence between two propositions $A$ and $B$ as $A \equiv B$.

To determine logical equivalence, we can utilize two different methods: truth tables and logical equivalence rules.

# Truth Tables
Determining logical equivalence through a truth table for propositions involves simply checking the values for the possibilities of both propositions to see if they match.

| p   | q   | p $\lor$ q | q $\lor$ p |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          | T          |
| T   | F   | T          | T          |
| F   | T   | T          | T          |
| F   | F   | F          | F          |

# Logical Equivalence Rules
Logical equivalence rules are rules we can apply to derive the logically equivalent propositions of a given proposition.

Some foundational equivalence rules:
- Law of Implication
- Contrapositive

- DeMorgan's Law
- Negation
- Double Negation

- Distributivity
- Commutativity
- Associativity

- Identity
- Idempotency
- Domination
- Absorption
