Logic forms the foundation of mathematical reasoning, allowing us to distinguish between what we can say is true and what is false. Propositions, then, form the basic building blocks of logic.

# Overview
A proposition is a well-formed true or false statement, a statement holding a truth value. 

Propositions, at their simplest form, are considered atomic propositions. They represent simple statements, such as "It is sunny" or "It is hot".

From these simple statements, we can formulate more complicated statements, compound propositions, by taking multiple atomic propositions and combining through the use of logical operators.

# Logical Operators
The following operators can be used to combine atomic propositions:
1) The "not" operator, denoted $\neg$
2) The "and" operator, denoted $\land$
3) The "or" operator, denoted $\lor$
4) The "exclusive or" operator, denoted $\oplus$
5) The "implication" operator, denoted $\rightarrow$
6) The "biconditional" operator, denoted $\leftrightarrow$ 

The possible values for a compound proposition are represented through truth tables.

| p   | q   | p $\lor$ q |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | T          |
| F   | T   | T          |
| F   | F   | F          |
