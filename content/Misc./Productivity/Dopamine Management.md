# What is Dopamine?
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which plays a role in motivation, drive, and excitement. Dopamine exists within us maintained at a baseline level, with various events in our day-to-day life causing peaks in dopamine level.

# Managing our Dopamine Levels
For us to then manage our dopamine levels, it's necessary that we do our best to avoid participating in events that cause a substantial peak in dopamine levels. These types of events which cause substantial peaks result in sharp drops in dopamine below the baseline, hence why having to study or do chores is more difficult after something like scrolling social media.

# Dopamine Detoxxing
Simply avoiding dopamine inducing events is easier said than done. There are a few steps in which we can detox from dopamine to:

1) Preparation
	- Identify your purpose
	- Cut out distractions
	- Take a look at your diet
2) Execution
	- There are other, more natural sources of dopamine to aid with boredom
	- Try to find alternative, more beneficial hobbies to replace bad ones
