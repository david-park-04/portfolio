Distractions are everywhere. From things like social media to television, avoiding distractions can feel like an uphill battle. How do we break free from distractions then?

The first step is recognition. Recognize that you're getting distracted. Recognize that it's becoming a problem. Recognize that this pattern of being distracted is on track to prevent you from achieving your goals. 

Once you've identified the problem, put as many barriers as possible between yourself and the distraction. Make it easier for yourself to not be tempted by distractions by putting your phone in a different room, limiting screen time, installing app/website blockers, etc. 

Now that you've separated yourself from the unwanted behavior, maintain or increase that distance. Whenever you're bored, know that it's the thing that's causing you to be distracted which makes it so that you're bored. Whenever you're tempted, know that giving up now is not just one small decision, but the first step in taking the wrong path. Imagine the person you want to become. Now, imagine the person you're likely to become if you stay distracted. Make the right choice.
