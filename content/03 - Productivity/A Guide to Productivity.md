## Learning Effectively
Foreword: While effective learning helps us ultimately learn more in less time, it isn't the same as fast, easy learning. The process of trying to understand material will inevitably need to be effortful to have impact.

The optimal steps for learning can be broken down roughly into 3 stages:
1) Priming
2) Encoding
3) Retrieval

### Priming
Priming is the process of gaining a foundational understanding of what you're about to learn. By attempting to first form a bigger picture of the material, you create anchor points through which you can identify relevance.

To properly prime, skim through the content to pick out what you believe are the important keywords and topics. While you do so, briefly attempt to gain a vague understanding of the connection between keywords and topics to create the anchor points for future use.

### Encoding
Encoding in learning is the process of juggling around with information so that it is understood and remembered by the brain. 

While you're diving into the learning material, ask yourself questions, such as:
1) What is it?
2) Why is it important?
3) How is it relevant?

Take notes in a minimal manner and only when needed to off-load information.

### Retrieval
Retrieval is how you fill in the gaps in your knowledge and strengthen your understanding. 

When practicing retrieval:
- Revise what you've learned as soon as possible to avoid losing context.
- Manipulate the content as to be able to summarize it and create an intuitive mind map.
- Practice active recall and spaced repetition.
- Apply the material.
- Teach it and write about it.

Additionally, depending on different types of content, it can be helpful to emphasize certain learning methods and incorporate various memorization techniques. When learning something procedural, for example, it's best to do practice problems frequently.

Beyond these stages, it's also important to realize how your mindset plays into learning. Learning, becoming a better version of yourself, is inherently enjoyable, but easy dopamine sources and lack of engagement with material can make learning seem less fun. Cut out distractions and try to interact with content further through involving more of your senses, imagining you're having a conversation with the author, visualizing heavily, talking to yourself, etc.

## Habits and Regulation of Emotion
### Habits
See [[Atomic Habits]] for more details.

The act of forming long-lasting habits can be summarized as letting ourselves take on new identities. If you wish to have some quality, imagine you do have the quality, and live life in such a manner that you are someone aligning with this belief.

### Regulation of Emotion
- Stress: Your reaction to stress is a choice. Focus on what you're able to control.
- Unhappiness: Practice gratitude. Instead of wanting more, concentrate on needing less.
- Bored/Demotivated: What about your identity is unwilling to engage with the material? Are there more active methods of learning to attempt to bring the content to life, to make it more fun? Look to hobbies if necessary or seek out new experiences.

## Time Management
Failing to plan is planning to fail, but similarly, so is over-planning. When there exists too many tasks in your schedule, it no longer becomes realistic. Having so many things to do shrinks your margin for error when going about your day. You force yourself to constantly be in a time-crunch and neglect the possibility of miscellaneous events that might pop up in your schedule.

Instead of cramming your schedule in hopes that you get more done, it's better to control what you sacrifice instead of being forced to sacrifice everything. A system for time management can be constructed through the consideration of two factors for tasks: priority and size. 

**Priority**  
Organize the order in which you complete tasks to match with what the highest priority is at the given moment in time. By doing so, you minimize the loss incurred when you're unable to complete everything you planned. 

**Size**  
Considering the size of the task is then how you block out time in our schedule. For each given task, multiply the estimated time for the task by 2. With this increase in the room for error, you can reduce feelings of helplessness when things don't work out as you originally thought.
