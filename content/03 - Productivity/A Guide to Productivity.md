## Time Management
Failing to plan is planning to fail, but similarly, so is over-planning. When there exists too many tasks in your schedule, it no longer becomes realistic. Having so many things to do shrinks your margin for error when going about your day. You force yourself to constantly be in a time-crunch and neglect the possibility of miscellaneous events that might pop up in your schedule.

Instead of cramming your schedule in hopes that you get more done, it's better to control what you sacrifice instead of being forced to sacrifice everything. A system for time management can be constructed through the consideration of two factors for tasks: priority and size. 

**Priority**
Organize the order in which you complete tasks to match with what the highest priority is at the given moment in time. By doing so, you minimize the loss incurred when you're unable to complete everything you planned. 

**Size**
Considering the size of the task is then how you block out time in our schedule. For each given task, multiply the estimated time for the task by 2. With this increase in the room for error, you can reduce feelings of helplessness when things don't work out as you originally thought.
