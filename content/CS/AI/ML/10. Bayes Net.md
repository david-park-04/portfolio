A Bayes Net is a graphical model, a directed acyclic graph, that represents the Joint Probability Distribution for some random variables and thus enables easy inference.

# Structure
- The conditional probability table is written for every variable given its ancestors
- Each node is a random variable
- Each edge asserts a dependency

# Idea
Instead of having to write a massive probability table, we factorize the Joint Probability Distribution:

$P(X_1, X_2, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Parents(X_i))$

# Determining (In)Dependence Between Nodes
- A node's Markov blanket is the smallest set of nodes to determine that a node is independent of its network. The blanket if formed by the node's parent, children, and children's parents.

## Local Semantics (Parent define dependence)
A node is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents.

## Global Semantics (Full network)
### D-Separation
