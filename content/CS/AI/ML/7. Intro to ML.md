The idea of machine learning is feeding data to an algorithm, from which it "learns" to result in a model.

Having a model, then, allows for working on problems that couldn't be tackled with just hand-crafted algorithms that can't modify themselves.

# Models
There are two types of models we introduce:
1. Classifiers
	- Buckets things, performing classification
2. Regressors
	- Predicts continuous values (e.g. temperature, height), performing regression

We'll focus on classifiers. The process for machine learning can be divided into two phases: a training phase and a testing phase.

## Training a Model
For classification to occur, we first need features to consider. With selected features, we can then begin bucketing each sample in our data set by drawing a line through our data set. The accuracy of the line is then adjusted based on the parameters (variables) of the line.

### Accuracy
The accuracy of an algorithm can be determined through the number of points incorrectly classified, given that the labels are known.

Instead of randomly adjusting parameters, a set of linear inequalities can be solved to determine the weights for our learned model. 

We can stop tweaking the model once we meet termination criteria.

## Testing a Model
A model is tested by being given unseen data, our test data. A data set is usually split into 60% for training, 20% for validation (iterative development), and 20% for testing.
