The idea of machine learning is feeding data to an algorithm, from which it "learns" to result in a model.

Having a model, then, allows for working on problems that couldn't be tackled with just hand-crafted algorithms that can't modify themselves.

# Models
There are two types of models we introduce:
1. Classifiers
	- Buckets things, performing classification
2. Regressors
	- Predicts continuous values (e.g. temperature, height), performing regression

We'll focus on classifiers. The process for machine learning can be divided into two phases: a training phase and a testing phase.

## Training a Model
For classification to occur, we first need features to consider. With selected features, we can then begin bucketing each sample in our data set while aiming for higher accuracy.

### Accuracy
The accuracy of an algorithm can be determined through the number of points incorrectly classified, given that the labels are known.



## Testing a Model
