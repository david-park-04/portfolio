# What does AI mean?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a term without a very well explained definition. We understand what it means to be artificial, but intelligence and what it means to be intelligent is complicated. Due to human intelligence being complex and encompassing a wide range of abilities, we can associate intelligence with some general definition, but can't quite define an exact definition of everything a machine needs to be able to do to mimic human intelligence (refer to the summer of '56).

# Overview of the Field
AI is the field of creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.

Machine learning and deep learning are then subsets of the field, with machine learning involving machines learning from data and deep learning involving machine learning with neural networks.

# History
- Idea of AI dates back to ~400 B.C.
- 1950: Turing Test - seeing whether a machine can pass as human
- 1956 Summer: Workshop that aimed to see if all aspects of intelligence could be precisely defined for a machine (ongoing!)
- Rise of AI in recent years

# Terminology
Strong AI: Human-level intelligence of an AI
Weak AI: Less intelligent than strong AI
Superintelligence: Far exceeds human intelligence
