# What does AI mean?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a term without a very well explained definition. While we understand what it means to be artificial, we don't quite understand intelligence and what it means to be intelligent since we don't fully understand intelligence in humans. Human intelligence is complex and encompasses a very wide range of abilities, making it hard to put into words to create a precise definition. As a result of this, we instead rely on a task-based definition (learning, planning, problem solving, etc.).

# Overview of the Field
AI is the field of creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.

Machine learning and deep learning are then subsets of the field, with machine learning involving machines learning from data and deep learning involving machine learning with neural networks.

Outside of machine learning, we have classical AI, in which we teach the machine how to do things explicitly.

# History
- Idea of AI dates back to ~400 B.C.
- 1950: Turing Test - seeing whether a machine can pass as human
- 1956 Summer: Workshop that aimed to see if all aspects of intelligence could be precisely defined for a machine (ongoing!)
- Rise of AI in recent years

# Terminology
Strong AI: Human-level intelligence of an AI
Weak AI: Less intelligent than strong AI
Superintelligence: Far exceeds human intelligence
