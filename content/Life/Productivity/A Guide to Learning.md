A general guide to effectively learning.

# Priming
Before building on our knowledge, it's first helpful to have the stable foundation necessary to be able to do so. Through priming, we gain a foundational understanding of a topic by familiarizing ourselves with what content we're about to learn and skimming through keywords.

# First Pass
During the first learning event for a topic, we continue to follow the principle of trying to gain a general understanding of the different content involved before diving into specifics. While learning, ask yourself: 
1) What is it?
2) Why is it important?
3) How does it relate to what I already know? (Prior knowledge and foundational understanding)

# Revision
After the first learning event, it's necessary to revisit the content we learned, dialing down on what the content is (diving into more specific details) and how the information connects to one another. Ideally, we want to revise the material we learn as soon as possible after the first learning event. After the first revision, we then tackle the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve through spaced repetition. 

To dive deeper into what the content is, we identify the holes in our knowledge through practice and attempting to teach what we know, testing to see if we can reconstruct and manipulate the information we've learned. 

To know how information connects to one another, we refer back to our thoughts during the first pass of the learning event where we questioned how information related to what we already knew. Using this information, we create a mind map where we connect different concepts and focus on being able to develop clearer, more intuitive groupings and connections between these concepts. By doing so, we invent a framework in which we can think about the topic and retain the knowledge we've learned with less struggle.
