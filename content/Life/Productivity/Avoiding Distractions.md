In a world full of notifications, short form content, and open tabs, staying focused can feel harder than ever. Despite your best efforts, the day seems to disappear with little work accomplished. 

These distractions aren't just annoying -- they're expensive, costing us time and potential. 

So how do you break the cycle?

It starts with defining your purpose.
# Defining Your Purpose
To first understand why you should avoid distractions, it's necessary to clarify for yourself why being distracted is bad to begin with. 

Ask yourself, "What do I want to get out of life -- and how does wasting time pull me away from this?" 

Personally speaking, I believe that the purpose of life is to experience the full range of being human -- to go through diverse experiences, connect with others, and fulfill your full potential. Once you've gotten clear on your purpose, you can begin to understand the magnitude of distractions. Not just bad habits, but also barriers between where you are now and the life you wish to live.

# Forming Barriers
By developing a reason to continue to swim against the tide when things get tough, we can then start distancing ourselves from distractions through website blockers and other restrictions.

Putting in place barriers to make it more difficult to give in to impulses, we gain time to evaluate the weight of our actions.

#  Keeping on Track
- [[Time Management]]
- Identify with who you want to be
- Find habits to replace your distractions (reading, exercising)
- Understand the privilege in being able to work
